# Changelog

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-03

- Feedback loop: adverse events captured to `feedback/log.jsonl` (issue_key clustering), review trigger (≥2 repeats from ≥2 sessions, or ≥5 pending), consolidation through the normal spec→executor→verifier pipeline with promotion gate, smallest-surface mapping, and privacy scrub.
- New hard rule 4: log adverse events before moving on; a missing record is a process failure.
- Failure triage before the escalation ladder: spec defects and environment failures no longer burn executor attempts.
- Continue-vs-spawn rule for executor reuse; task board single-writer rule; verifiers now also check for unintended tracked changes.
- Recon starts by reading `feedback/SUMMARY.md`.
- Published as a public repo with `scripts/publish-check.sh` (tracked-file allowlist + secret/path leak scan).

## 1.0.0

- Initial orchestrator skill: hard rules, Sonnet/Haiku/Opus routing table with Codex exception channel, self-contained spec template, dispatch by pointer, fresh-context verification with escalation ladder, final review.
